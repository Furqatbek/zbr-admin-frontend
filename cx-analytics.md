## Metrics Definitions

### NPS (Net Promoter Score)

NPS measures customer loyalty and satisfaction using a 0-10 scale.

**Formula:**
```
NPS = ((Promoters - Detractors) / Total Responses) × 100
```

**Score Categories:**

- **Passives (7-8)**: Satisfied but not enthusiastic customers

### CX Summary

Comprehensive summary combining all CX metrics.

**Overall Score Calculation:**
```
CX Score = (NPS × 30%) + (Ratings × 40%) + (Support × 30%)
```

Where:
- NPS is normalized from -100..100 to 0..100
- Ratings are normalized from 1..5 to 0..100
- Support is based on SLA compliance and CSAT

**CX Status Levels:**
| Score Range | Status    |
|-------------|-----------|
| 80-100      | EXCELLENT |
| 60-79       | GOOD      |

## Caching Strategy

| Cache | TTL | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| NPS Metrics | 10 min | NPS data changes infrequently |
| Restaurant Ratings | 5 min | Moderate change frequency |
| Courier Ratings | 5 min | Moderate change frequency |
| App Store Ratings | 5 min | External data, moderate updates |
| Support Tickets | 1 min | Real-time operational data |
| CX Summary | 5 min | Aggregate of all metrics |

Cache invalidation happens automatically when new data is submitted through the respective APIs. Manual cache invalidation is available through the cache management endpoints.

## Best Practices

1. **Date Range Selection**: Use appropriate date ranges for meaningful analysis. Weekly or monthly periods work best for trend analysis.

2. **SLA Configuration**: Set SLA hours based on business requirements. Default is 24 hours, but high-priority tickets may need shorter SLAs.

3. **Cache Usage**: Use cache invalidation sparingly. The TTLs are designed to balance freshness with performance.

4. **Agent Performance**: Review agent metrics to identify training needs and recognize top performers.

5. **NPS Trends**: Monitor NPS trends weekly to identify changes in customer sentiment early.
